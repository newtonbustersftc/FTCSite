    <h1>Newton Busters FTC is sponsored by Girl Scouts</h1>

    <img src="images/FTCGirlScouts.jpg" width = "100%">
    <p>The Newton Busters FTC team has a sponsorship from Girl Scouts since the team is focused on women empowerment,
        trying to improve meager statistics that there are only 25% women in STEM occupations.
        There are far fewer girls participating in robotics clubs than boys. However our teams is not limited to the girls.
        The Newton Busters FTC team has the following girls scout members (left to right): <b>Simone Wall</b>, <b>Athena Zheng</b>,
        <b>Samantha Fountain</b>, <b>Yara Goldina</b>, <b>Jasmine Wu</b>. Other members are <b>Brandon Lee</b>,
        <b>Alex Yasumoto</b>, <b>Gavin Fountain</b>, and junior member <b>Hayden Fountain</b>.</p>
